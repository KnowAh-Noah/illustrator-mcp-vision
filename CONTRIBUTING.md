## Layout

```
cep/
  CSXS/manifest.xml   two extensions: headless server + optional status panel
  server.html         headless entry, owns the Node process
  index.html          status panel
  client/             CEP-side JS: evalScript bridge, server startup, panel UI
  server/             MCP protocol, HTTP transport, tool surface, contact sheet
  host/ae/            ExtendScript that runs inside After Effects
  host/ai/            ExtendScript that runs inside Illustrator
  host/json-polyfill.jsx  shared by both hosts
test/
  unit/               runs anywhere, gates CI
  integration/        needs a live After Effects
scripts/              lint, dev install (sh + ps1), .zxp packaging
```

The split that matters: **`cep/host/*.jsx` runs inside After Effects on an ES3
engine, everything else runs on CEP's Node.** They are different languages with
the same file extension family, and mixing them up is the easiest mistake to
make here.

## More than one app

The extension is listed for After Effects (`AEFT`) and Illustrator (`ILST`).
Each app loads its own copy in its own process, so each runs its own server.
What differs per app is decided in one place, `cep/server/app-profile.js`:
port (8791 / 8792), token folder, service name, tool file (`tools.js` /
`tools-illustrator.js`), MCP instructions and doc resources. The manifest gives
each host its own `DispatchInfo`, which is how each app gets its own
`host/<app>/host.jsx` and panel menu name. Everything else - HTTP, auth, the
MCP protocol, the evalScript bridge, the contact sheet - is shared.

After Effects keeps exactly what it had before, so existing configs keep
working. Outside CEP (unit tests) `MCP_HOST_APP` picks the profile, defaulting
to After Effects.

Adding an app: a profile in `app-profile.js`, a `Host` and two `DispatchInfo`
blocks in the manifest, a `cep/host/<app>/` host, a tools file, and docs under
`docs/<app>/`. `test/unit/app-profile.test.cjs` checks the wiring.

## Why it is built this way

The MCP server runs **inside** After Effects, in a headless CEP extension, and
reaches ExtendScript through `CSInterface.evalScript`:

```
MCP client --HTTP--> Node server (headless CEP extension) --evalScript--> ExtendScript --> app.project
```

Each alternative was measured and rejected:

- **`aerender`** can run scripts through an undocumented `-r` flag, but every
  call cold-boots After Effects and it cannot touch the project the user has
  open. The build-look-correct loop goes from seconds to minutes.
- **AppleScript `DoScript`** returns `app.exitCode`, a single integer, not the
  script's result. `evalScript` returns a string, which is the whole reason for
  CEP.
- **The MCP SDK** needs Node 18; CEP 12 ships Node 17.7.2. MCP over HTTP is a
  small JSON-RPC surface, so it is implemented directly, with no `node_modules`.
- **UXP** hosts panels in After Effects but has no public scripting API there
  yet. The host layer sits behind the transport so a future port is not a
  rewrite.

## Dev loop

```bash
npm run install:dev      # macOS   (npm run install:dev:win on Windows)
```

Then restart After Effects. `cep/` is symlinked, so edits are on disk
immediately — but what picks them up depends on which process loads the file:

| Changed | To see it |
|---|---|
| `cep/host/**` | `ae_diagnostics {command: "reloadHost"}`, or restart After Effects |
| `cep/server/**`, `cep/server.html`, `cep/client/{server-boot,start-server,bridge}.js` | Restart After Effects |
| `cep/index.html`, `cep/client/panel.js` | Close and reopen the panel |

The server runs in the **headless** extension, which starts once with After
Effects, so reopening the panel does not reload it. The host is compiled once
per extension start too, which is what `reloadHost` exists to work around —
without it, on-disk source and running behaviour can silently disagree.

## Verifying

```bash
npm run lint             # parse, ES3 dialect, require/#include/manifest resolution
npm test                 # unit tests, no After Effects needed
npm run test:integration # against a live After Effects
./test/verify-live.sh    # against a running extension, nothing stubbed
./test/verify-live-illustrator.sh   # the same, against Illustrator
```

`npm run lint` and `npm test` gate CI. The integration suite cannot — no hosted
runner has After Effects — so **run it before tagging a release.** It has caught
more real bugs than the unit tests have.

## Writing ExtendScript

`cep/host/*.jsx` is ES3. The linter fails the build on `const`, `let`, arrow
functions and template literals, because the failure mode inside After Effects
is a modal dialog that blocks the whole application, not a stack trace.

Beyond syntax:

- **There is no native `JSON`.** The polyfill is `#include`d; don't assume it.
- **`return` is illegal at top level.** Everything is wrapped in an IIFE.
- **Anything that can throw must be inside a `try`.** An error escaping
  `beginSuppressDialogs` hangs After Effects on a modal until a human clicks OK.
  Suppression wraps serialization and the reply too, not just the work.
- **`evalScript` collapses every failure to `"EvalScript error."`** — the host
  serializes its own errors or they are lost.
- **Don't coerce an Error with `+`.** `"msg: " + e` throws
  *"Object of type Error found where a Number, Array, or Property is needed"*.
  Use `String(e)`.
- **Teardown is manual.** `comp.remove()` orphans solids and leaves an
  auto-created "Solids" folder; undo groups do not revert themselves.

## Adding an op

1. Implement it in the right `cep/host/ae/ops-*.jsx` table. Take stable ids, never
   indices. Don't catch your own errors — `__mcp_exec` handles that uniformly.
2. If it mutates the project, add it to `__mcp_mutating` in `cep/host/ae/ops.jsx`
   so it runs inside an undo group.
3. Expose it through a tool in `cep/server/tools.js`, or as a new `command` on
   an existing one. Prefer widening an existing tool: a few fat tools beat
   many thin ones for a model choosing between them.
4. Write the description for a model that has never seen After Effects. State
   the token cost if the output can be large, and the idiom if there is a wrong
   way to use it.
5. Add an integration case. Batch ops need a case proving partial success —
   some succeed, some fail, and the errors carry machine-readable codes.

## Releasing

```bash
npm run test:integration   # the gate CI cannot provide
npm version <patch|minor|major>
git push --follow-tags
```

The release workflow refuses to build if the tag and `package.json` disagree.
Signing is optional: without `ZXP_CERT_B64` and `ZXP_CERT_PASS` secrets it
produces an unsigned `.zxp` that installs only where `PlayerDebugMode` is set.
